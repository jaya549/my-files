			<h2>Python Overview</h2>
			<h3> Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
			<br>
			Python is Interpreted : Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.<br>
			Python is Interactive : You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</h3>
